## Prerequisites

You need these prerequisites before installing the SDK:
* A functional Lithium community on release 15.4 or higher. Check the
version on the version page located at _stage_url_/status/version. **Note:** If your Community stage
server is running 15.6 or earlier and you download the latest version of the SDK, you might encounter
a "Supported minimum version on server is 15.7" error. See {@link /refer/troubleshoot Troubleshooting}
to resolve.

* Your Studio/Admin account must have the "Use the SDK" permission in order to generate an upload token to use SDK commands.
If you cannot access **Studio > Advanced > SDK**, contact the community administrator.

* SSL must be configured for your community. Contact Lithium Support if you are unsure whether this configuration
set.

* If your stage site has IP restriction turned on, you must whitelist IPs that will interact with the stage server using the SDK.
Contact Lithium Support to whitelist IP addresses as needed.

* Access to the SDK tab in Studio. This tab generates an
upload token needed to run SDK scripts and deploy your plugin to the stage environment.
Each developer uses a separate account to log into Studio and generates a separate upload token. This ensures that
SDK plugin submissions are attributed to the a specific user account in the Versions tab in Studio, which
helps track with developer submitted which version of the SDK plugin to the stage environment.

* A Mac (10.8+), Linux (CentOS 6.5+), or Windows (7+) environment

* <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">git</a>. After you install git, run `git` from a new command line to check that it is available
* <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">node.js</a> version 4.x.x and <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/" target="_blank">npm</a>. Our developer
environment runs on top of node.js. When you do local development, it is on a node.js
server that we proxy to a Lithium community instance. Usually, npm (Node Package Manager)
gets bundled with the node environment, but verify that you have it.

    * Run `node -v` at the command line to check whether node is installed
    * Run `npm` at the command line to check whether npm is installed

    If you are installing node for the first time, do not install it using `sudo` or in administrator mode. Also, ensure that
the directory where npm installs modules to is permissioned so that you do not need to use sudo or administrator mode
when you run npm install.


Windows-specific prerequisites:

* While installing git, select **Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt** on the dialog window **Adjusting your PATH environment**

* <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/" target ="_blank">Python v2.7.3</a>. Be sure that you have a PYTHON environment variable and that it is set to
`drive:\path\to\python.exe`, not to a folder.
    ** After you have installed Python, run `python` from a new command line to check that it is available.

* <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/vs2013-community-vs.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2013</a>. **Note:** Visual Studio
2015 is not supported at this time.

## Installing the SDK and dependencies
We use two npm packages in all of our project repositories: <a href="http://gulpjs.com/" target="_blank">gulp</a> and
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/lithium-sdk" target="_blank">lithium-sdk</a>. Install them by issuing
the following statements in a command line:

```
npm install gulp -g
npm install lithium-sdk -g
```
The `-g` flag denotes the package specified will be installed globally on your system.

**Tip:** When you install a node package globally, the package is put in
`usr/local/lib/node_modules` and a symlink is put in `usr/local/bin`. When you run these
commands as yourself (`$USER`), you will not have access to write to these locations, and
you might get a permission error that looks something like this:
`npm ERR! Please try running this command again as root/Administrator.` See the troubleshooting instructions below if you see this error.

**Note:** You might see warnings generated while installing `lithium-sdk` that look
something like the following. They are a normal part of the installation process and you can ignore them.

```
    10 warnings generated.
    CC(target) Release/obj.target/expat/deps/libexpat/lib/xmlrole.o
    LIBTOOL-STATIC Release/libexpat.a
    CXX(target) Release/obj.target/node_expat/node-expat.o
    SOLINK_MODULE(target) Release/node_expat.node
    SOLINK_MODULE(target) Release/node_expat.node: Finished
```

### Troubleshooting permission errors in Windows environments
If you have permission issues when running the install scripts, run the installation commands in <a href ="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Cc947813(v=WS.10).aspx">Administrator mode</a>.

### Troubleshooting permission errors in Non-Windows environments
If you have permission issues, use change permission for the folders where global packages are being installed so
that $USER can write to those directories and subdirectories.

*For Mac and Linux:*

 * `cd /usr/local/lib/`
 * `sudo chown -R $USER node_modules`
     * Give yourself write access to `/bin`:
 * `sudo chmod -R a+w /usr/bin`


If you are still getting permissions errors, use the following. If you use `sudo` you will have to run SDK scripts in sudo.
```
sudo npm install gulp -g
sudo npm install lithium-sdk -g
```
